## How does it work?

Well, very simple! Let's show you via the hands of a simple calculation example!

An investor has noticed your bot and is very interested in using it and they're using their own funds along with your bots:

`Investor X is willing to invest 1.000.000 in total funds (can be multiple bots) with a fee of 0,01% per trade`

You - as the algorithm supplier will receive 60% of that 0,01% fee! Now you might think that that's not much due to it being 0,01%. However, this amount will be multiplied the second a buy and a sell happens as both the buy and the sell will have this 0,01% fee.

Now, you might think it's just one trade and that it's not a significant amount, but don't fret, this amount can be multiplied up to 30 times with every single day having a buy and a sell. This would equal the following:

`1000000 x 0,0001 x 0,6 x 2 x 30 = 3600 per month (this is the full amount the algorithm supplier makes per month)`

That's 3600 that you can earn with your algorithm! If your bot trades twice a day, it can go up to 7200 a month that you can earn with your algorithm by using our platform!
