# dema-backtesting-module

## Running
### Requirements for running without Docker
Running this backtesting engine just takes a quite simple steps if you have the right things configured. Things you need:
1. Python 3 installed on your system
2. Pip Running on your system (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
3. Some code editor (PyCharm Community or Visual Studio Code Community works fine)
4. Install TA-Lib dependencies (see: https://github.com/mrjbq7/ta-lib Installation -> Dependencies)
5. Very very little knowlegde about Python

### Requirements for running with Docker
1. Docker installed on your system (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Some code editor (PyCharm Community or Visual Studio Code Community works fine)
3. Very very little knowlegde about Python


#### Running without Docker
First run:
```` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

After installing, you can run the backtesting module:
````
python3 main.py
````

#### Running with Docker
First run:
```` 
docker build . -t dema-engine:alpha
````

To run the container: 
````
docker run --rm dema-engine:alpha
````

Note: do not forget '--rm' as your Docker will keep the container if you do, which is not necessary and will cause extreme increase in memory usage.
