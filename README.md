# Running

## Requirements for running with Docker (recommended)

Running the Engine just takes a few simple things:

1. Docker installed on your system (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Some code editor (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
3. Abillity to copy + paste and some motivation to figure things out.

## Requirements for running without Docker (alternative)

Running the Engine just takes a few simple things:

1. Have Python 3 installed on your system (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Pip Running on your system (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
3. Some code editor (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
4. Install TA-Lib dependencies (see: https://github.com/mrjbq7/ta-lib Installation -> Dependencies)

## Running without Docker

First run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing, you can run the Engine:

```
python3 main.py
```

## Running with Docker

First run:

```
docker build . -t dema-engine:alpha
```

To run the container:

```
docker run --rm dema-engine:alpha
```

To run the container with a volume (rebuilding not necessary on code changes)

```
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/engine" dema-engine:alpha
```

Note: do not forget '--rm' as your Docker will keep the container if you do, which is not necessary and will cause extreme increase in memory usage.

## Using `make`

As the `docker` commands listed above are not so developer friendly, we added a `Makefile` to help you save some tears. You'll need to have `make` installed on your system (check using `make --version`), which is on most computers by default. If you don't, run `brew install make` (homebrew needed), `sudo apt install make` or `choco install make` (chocolately needed) for MacOS, Linux or Windows, respectively.

To build the image:

```
make build
```

To run the container:

```
make run
```

To run on volume:

```
make runv
```

To build and run:

```
make
```
